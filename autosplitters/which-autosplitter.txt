RECOMNMENDATIONS
	1-character
		use death-splits if you smoke bomb glitch & set up a hotkey to reset runs
		use the plain autosplitter if you don't smoke bomb glitch
	4-character
		do NOT use death-splits
		use only-act-3 if you use a compact layout

Suffixes: 
	(1) "Steam" 
		-- works when StS is run on Steam (the exe name changed, so this required a fix)
		-- otherwise, it works when StS is booted directly via script, terminal, etc
	(2) "death splits"
		-- turns any player death into a split rather than a reset
		-- useful so that smoke bomb skipping the final boss leads to a split
		-- bad for 4-character (splits several times during the Heart event floor)
		-- makes no difference for A20
	(3) "only-act-3"
		-- no longer splits against Act I and II bosses
		-- recommended for 4-character runs with a compact split layout
	(4) "climb"
		-- for ascension climb speedruns
		-- starts upon first run embark
		-- splits on Ruby, Emerald, Sapphire, and Amethyst achievements
		-- splits on each ascension unlock
		-- splits on A20 achievement
	(5) "all-achievements"
		-- for all achievements speedruns
		-- starts upon file creation
		-- splits on all "gem" and "gem+" achievements
