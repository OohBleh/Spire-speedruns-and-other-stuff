# Spire-speedruns-and-other-stuff

Welcome to OohBleh's emporium of all things Slay the Spire!  
We have speedrun guides, speedrun file setups, and much much more (well, not yet, but I am a mere mortal...)  

We love answering questions.  If you're interested in learning more about speedrunning and other ways to push the game to it's limits, consider joining:
